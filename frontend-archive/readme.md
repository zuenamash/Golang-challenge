# Web development challenge
In the following challenge, you will be required to design and build a frontend rendering data from the `files` folder.

## Introduction
You are tasked with designing and creating an interface  to visualize data from a food delivery center.

The test data is available in the `files` folder.
The frontend should use the data from this folder and show it in a table and a graph tracking number of deliveries over time. It should also allow the user to filter based on hotel, driver and time range.


### Frontend design

Using Figma or a design tool of you choosing, design a dashboard for both mobile and desktop view that shows the following:
- User can see a table of deliveries showing driver name, hotel name, rating, start time and end time. The table should have filters for driver name, hotel name, start time (from and to) and end time (from and to)
- A visualization that shows top rated drivers (based on average rating) filterable by hotel name. You can choose a valid representation of this data.
- A visualization that shows number of trips taken over time filterable by driver and hotel. You can choose a valid representation of this data.

### Frontend

Using a react js and chart js, implement the designs created above using the data from the `files` folder.

 By default, the time range should be set to the last thirty days and no hotel or driver should be selected. When no hotel / driver is selected, show data from all hotels / drivers.
